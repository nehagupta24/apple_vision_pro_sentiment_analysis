Kevin Fuller,3,"The Apple Vision Pro is extremely innovative; there's no doubt about that. Watching movies, looking at old photos and/or videos, and playing the immersive games on the AVP are breathtaking. Seriously, those features on this headset are out of this world good and no other headset can replicate that experience at the moment. 

The ""passthrough"" feature is meh at best. I was able to walk around my college campus pretty well with these on. However, I made sure not to walk too fast as there's some latency with it. The FOV is pretty limited and I often found myself needing to check my surroundings quite often as you basically lose most if not all your peripheral vision when you put these on. Also, using my Apple Watch while wearing the AVP was very difficult as the text on the ...More"
Joseph Scroggins,2,"I have owned this device from the launch and I am beyond disappointed with apple. We are almost 6 months into the launch and it still feels like I am working with a BETA device/software. 

The apps on this device are VERY limited. You can't even arrange the apps on the home screen for easier use... they are just placed in alphabetical order and limited to a small amount per-page. Apple touts that it now has 1000+ apps for it, but majority of them are trash and useless. Apple didn't even have its own native apps available at first. Most of them are there now, but they don't operate to full capacity. It's definitely not like having a computer at your finger tips, it operates more like an iPad. I'm sorry, but I need more functionality for most of the things that I am doing and ...More"
Tyler Haupt,5,"Never before was there a more expensive way to experience the Allegorical Cave! 
I would like to thank the Apple Team for not only delivering on their promise to disconnect me further and further from the world, but also for allowing me to segment myself from society for the purposes of marketing. I hope my biometric, internet, and personal data is well utilized by the Apple Team so that they can best manipulate shadows in optimal patterns allowing me to cease all manor of individual thought and finally become a being of instinct and routine behaviors. Please continue to drip feed me the illusion of happiness through complacency so that the world will never need to challenge me ever again.

I hope that some day we all are able to be directed by corporate marketing into ...More"
Sideboard,5,"If you like high-tech cutting-edge experiences, this is a product for you. Nothing else in the world offers this level of immersion and visual quality in a headset this lightweight and well-crafted. This is the Mona Lisa of Virtual Reality Headsets. You have to use Apple apps, not everything is available yet, but as a legitimate computing platform, software comes second to hardware. The haters of this product have no legs to stand on, as they have never even tried it out. Once you put on the headset, you are instantly aware that the future goes one of two ways: Immersive Mixed Reality Computing, or Heads-Up Display Augmented Reality. The Apple Vision Pro is a glimpse into one of our potential high-tech futures and I can't wait to watch the immersive shows that will be coming ...More"
James DeRose,4,"Absolutely love my Vision Pro. I was in the process of buying a new laptop (Currently own an M1 Pro) and planning on getting an M3. I wanted to know if the Vision pro could legitimately be used as a new computer? Yes and no. I would not sell my M1 as I use the Vision Pro as my second screen. There is a hefty cost to it, but lots of capabilities and more I am sure will come. There rarely are any Apple products that are ""cheap"" so it's tough when people say its way too expensive. I would suggest checking one out before buying it, but Apple definitely did a great job with this product and I am sure it will get better in the future. I have experienced minor bugs, but nothing crazy. Pros: Awesome display, great setup and compatibility. Cons: Price, touch sensitivity on occasion ...More"
Michael Min,5,"This is going to be a awesome product. It is meant for older people, so you should not buy it for your kid. However, it is a great product when you are bored of the outside. Also, this product is peasant money; anybody can buy this without breaking the bank. It can be pricey for some people, but overall Apple is going to make a fortune off this product. For example, Apple is making a lot of money off their stuff. So, this will make them even more money for the company. When this comes out, I am buying this thing no matter what! Lets go over the basics: One, the oculus battery dies out fast! I played it for 30 min, and my battery died. I feel like this battery is better than the other one. Two, why would apple just release this thing for the world of it. This product is going ...More"
Alexander G.,2,"The manufacturer seems like a nice person, but this thing is really such a disappointment. \n\n– The L/R tabs were of different tightnesses, the left side being too loose. \n– The velcro/pad are a total mismatch. The pad can slip off the forehead plate very very easily; try to make an adjustment and it'll likely slide. So you need to take the whole vision off and reset the positioning. \n– The velcro pad and the forehead plate are not sized to match. The pad's wings jut out the sides, plate's corners peek through top. \n– Adjustability is bare minimum. Can't change the angle at which the plate is held, and you can't hold the plate at a particular angle either–– it just sets into path of least resistance. Can't adjust the vertical distance of the plate. \n\nAllows open face ...More"
Guy C.,5,"Wow! This really works. I got the Basic Open Face System For the Apple Vision Pro and it REALLY helps with comfort. The included pad is very soft and the strap allows all the weight to be transferred to the forehead, eliminating the pressure on the face. It makes the Vision Pro feel lighter. (Actually, it is lighter without the light seal assembly). It is easy to put together and remove too. A few notes - the pad can be a bit difficult to get attached, though a slight flex of the plastic and wiggling of the pad gets it to secure better. The Vision Pro may also now alert you to the display being too close when you first put it on. Having the lenses closer does increase the FOV, though be careful if you walk around and bump something, since the lenses are closer to your eyes. I ...More"
Niranjan Bhat,5,"The transparent VR glass, eye & hand click are really from another level. You can see people automatically when you required!, AI will detect people. Quest 3 is better for games, but Vision pro experience as a professional & as a daily life is better. 
Main distinguish is other people can see your eyes, so you can talk without taking off everytime. 
Another big accomplishment is Real Avatar, Unlike quest 3 where you appear some funny animals, here in Vision pro, you actually look same as you! means live track your face and make 3D face avatar in real time and you can do facetime or walk through in the metaverse and meet your friends, You don't have to read your friend name on the avatar. Because you immediately recognize them and nobody looks funny avatars"
Brian Hernandez,1,"What is this supposed to be? It's front heavy VR headset. Please remove those goofy eyes from the front on the headset and either add a battery to the headset or have a battery with a removeable cable, as do you know how annoying the battery is with an attached cable. Not a lot of third party apps but I'm sure that will improve with time. No YouTube or Netflix thus alienates a good chunk unless you go through the browser. I understand the the metal on the front is to show off quality but it really adds to the front heaviness and while short term it's fine but long term its annoying. I can't justify this price because it doesn't have much of a use case and everyone is laughing at you when they see the eyes and not that I care much but the eyes on front look nothing like in the ...More"
Sign in with Apple user,5,"I came across this on Reddit and was very interested to see if it would work as well as advertised. I just received it, and let me tell you, it works extremely well. Does what it's supposed to. The FOV is greatly increased and absolutely no pressure on my cheeks, even with the solo strap. Also, in case anyone who uses the Zeiss lenses is wondering, this does work with them flawlessly. I did get the ""eyes too close,"" but I just dismiss the warning and smooth sailing from there. Will still use the light seal for movies but I can't ignore how much less isolated I feel while wearing. 5 stars all around."
Dom Meyer,4,"This may work well for many, but it works very poorly for my facial shape. It's impossible to keep the Vision Pro far enough from my eyes and nose while using this. Even when set at the furthest length, the open face system attachments slide away, causing the distance to drop and the Vision Pro to press against my nose. I've resorted to wrapping rubber bands around the Vision Pro arms to prevent this slipping, but even then the device is too close. Based on other reviews, it seems that this does work well for many face and head shapes, but if you have a big nose or more angular structure, this might not work well for you."
Niles,5,"All I can say is wow. I am a day one Vision Pro owner and I have tried most of the solutions to try to make it more comfortable. This forehead cushion is far and away the most ideal solution, and easily the most comfortable. It’s so easy to install, and it allows for very easy adjustments. The cushion is really high-quality as well. I have always struggled With the Vision Pro leaning on my nose, bridge, but this completely fixes the issue and allows me to use the headset without the light seal. Top-tier product!"
Nicholas C.,5,Spoke with the seller a day before I placed my order he responded quickly so I ordered and when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It’s obviously not something you would buy from the store quality as it’s 3D printed but the craftsmanship is really really good so no complaints. Just wanted to point that out for the really picky people. The unit is easily installed and works perfectly. The seller also included a QR code that links to how to install the unit. The instructions are easily followed. This is really cool and gives you a new way to enjoy the Apple Vision Pro.
Avesh J.,5,This thing has been a total game changer for my Apple Vision Pro. I was getting a little bummed out by all the pressure on my face when using the device. This thing has completely solved the problem and allows me to use the AVP for longer periods of time with no discomfort. The extra peripheral vision without the light seal is incredible and enhances the overall experience. I haven't used the light seal at all since I started using this. This really gets me excited about the possibilities with the AVP.
rmhall,5,"The Open Face System is a game changer for me. It makes wearing the Vision Pro so much more comfortable and makes the solo strap more functional without having to crank down the tightness. Now I can easily use it with or without the light shield as well, which has some great use cases. A must have purchase, and one, if not the best of the Vision Pro accessories I've picked up so far. I've had it for a few weeks now, and it is indispensable. Plenty of room for customization and tweaking too. Highly recommended!"
Paul D.,5,"I receieved exactly what was described. The adapters slide onto the AVP arms and the top pad snaps in and can be removed easily. The adapters don't have to be removed to go back to using the light shield. This is how Apple should have shipped the AVP. Without the light shield, it is basically like wearing a weightless pair of sunglasses and a hat. You can see out the sides for situational awareness. Good product, good value, good communication from seller and good shipping."
Jade Dumlao,1,"Ok, apple, if you think im spending 3500 bucks on a meta quest 2 ripoff, hell to the naw. Lets look at the comparisons, shall we?

The meta quest 2 and 3 can also do hand tracking.
They can also call phones and stuff
Be my guest if you wanna spend that much money on a gyatt dam headset
So, in conclusion, i dont think it should cost that much. Its insane. It should be like, 590 bucks or somethin i dont care if you spent 16 years on it. IT SHOULDNT BE THAT EXPENSIVE"
etsy.com Shopper,5,This thing is absolutely perfect. The cushion used along with the plastic allows it to flex a little bit over the top of your head - so it really doesn't apply much pressure (unlike the original Quest Pro design which was too hard. \n\nI was already modding the default configuration of the Vision Pro to make it more comfortable - and now this will be how I use it daily with the exception of using the interface while on flights. \n\nIf you're second guessing a purchase - do not hesitate. This turns the Vision Pro from something I could use for an hour at a time to ALL DAY (if I weren't married lol.)
Andrew R,2,"Innovative and love the idea however I priced mine out and with lenses, it will be 
 Apple Card Monthly Installments
$333.16/mo.per month for 12 months.
$3,998.00 Total
Price includes ZEISS Optical Inserts

I have better things to spend $4k on right now. 

Like the iPads and other Apple products Prices will come down in a couple of years once competitors come out. Right now the 1% and DIe hard techies will be buying these."
Vlad Chogoleff,1,"the product is truly amazing, the quality of the build, the picture quality, the apple ecosystem, but with 2 apps/videos available there is absolutly nothing to experience. The safari crashing like 30 times a day, the multi windows is getting blury, the lenses has a halo, the headset just simply doesn't work in a dark, and lastly the see thru quality is poor. I simply returned it, because after 2 days of playing it's start laying down on a couch and the $25/month applecare+ subscription won't help at all. Hope apple will come up with more content in a few years with a more reasonable price tag."
Rick Lay,3,"The clips don’t stay in place and slide forward. The AVP keeps telling me my eyes are too close to the lenses with and without inserts. When initially put on it is comfortable, but it does not stay in place. I’m concerned that after multiple installs and uninstalls, it will wear...I would have preferred the versions where the arms needed to be removed. It's probably safer. It may work for some people depending on the positioning and head size, but it not right for my big head. Took almost 2 weeks to arrive (because of the pad)."
Scott R.,5,This new stand is fantastic. Its sleek design is shaped to contour to the Vision Pro perfectly. I love this marble material option as it goes great with the black and white esthetics of the AVP. \n\nIt also works great with the new face shield provided separately from the same company. It alleviates some of the pressure from the face but also works with and without the Apple light leak shield. \n\nI highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed.
Cole Klingler,5,"Innovative product that increases efficiency. I highly recommend, the price tag is a burden but remember Apple allows credit monthly payment plans. Be sure to tell your cooperate supervisor that the apple eco system will promote a cutting edge solution that is corporate fatigue. Apple Vison Pro has a partnership with ""ZEISS"" Carl Zeiss AG is a swiss company known for their craftsmanship and high precession instruments that meet the demand of todays problems in all forms of sectors."
William T.,5,"Honestly, a game changer. I initially had the Vision Pro too close to my face, but after moving it back as far as possible, everything just felt right. It’s SO much more comfortable without the light shield. \n\nOnly complaint is the shield does not slide in easily, though I assume that’s to prevent it from falling out. The overall feel is fantastic, and it’s very easy to switch back. And everything still fits in my case."
Spring Complete,5,I really like it. It is better than the Quest 3 and has stunning visuals. Nothing quite as stunning as watching a movie in there with the equivalent of a 200 inch screen. And i can get quite a bit of work there done too with all the windows on display and easy accessibility. Only real complaint is the power situation which with the brick is not gracefully managed and the battery life being short.
Shaurya Tomar,2,"Great idea, I hope that Apple implements it well and this device actually becomes a productive device which can be seen in modern work-spaces.
But, just like every other Apple product, the price of this product is also through the roof. I would have appreciated even if apple sold this for 2000 USD. If 3500 USD is the cost of the first generation, I can do nothing but sink in sorrow when I think of the price of the next generations."
Vlary N.,5,It does exactly what it is intended to do. Now I can finally enjoy AVP for long periods of time. The only problem I have is the Velcro. It’s pretty weak and doesn’t stay on plastic especially when I adjust the plastic piece it disconnects. Solution is to just glue it or get a better one from Michael’s or something. I think it may not work for everyone bc of head size and hair. But it’s worth a try for 40$ or so
Laughter Centralize,1,"A month later! and my 600 dollar oculus is still more useful. Id feel better IF I SPENT 4k DOLLARS ON THE OCULUS!!!! All that 8k video! Picture! USELESSSSSSSSSS! I rather use my phone! Its a big iPhone on your face! 1 day of having, you watch some youtube, play cut the rope and get bored! By 3 days of using this you wont want to use it anymore"
Kenneth K.,5,"The seller went above and beyond and even threw in some free stuff. The quality of the product is amazing. It’s exactly what I was looking for and believe me I tried so many different printers and brands. And no, not all 3d prints are the same. Designs quality of materials even the way they print it all differs quite a bit. You get what you pay for. This is indeed the best out there."
Brenden Lane,5,wow it was so fun and good to use. the radiation in my eyes goes away after a few days. But I think there was a side affect. I can now breath colors and see in the dark. oh but at least I can now watch skibidi toilit in AR! which is a majore plus. over all very good product. however money is to big for sigma males as myself. ;)
Kane,5,"There are a number of different mods being created to make the Vision Pro headset more comfortable, I've tried a few and the open face design by TycoTech is by far the best one I've tried to date. It's easy to install/remove in less than a minute, so you can switch between the open face or the standard light shield setup depending on your preference. The open face design also distributes the weight off my cheeks making it more comfortable to wear for longer periods."
Jean-Denis H.,5,"Got mine yesterday (v2) and I tried it out today for 2 hours and it’s been GREAT. Installation was very straightforward (v3 looks even better), peripheral vision was great, very comfortable with nothing touching your face except your forehead. The controls worked perfectly as well. Glad to know that extra pads will be purchasable, that way I’ll have a “work” one and one or two “exercise” ones."
J S.,5,"This strap is REMARKABLE!! I feel zero pressure wearing my Vision Pro sitting, standing, or laying down. The two small clips included with the strap also help keep it in place and not slide. I've tried all sorts of comfort straps before (Annapro, AirCover, etc.) and none of them even come close to the level of comfort that this strap provides. I'm beyond impressed!"
Ozzie B.,5,"This is almost perfect for me. I won't ding it any stars, because it could be 100% perfect for someone else. That's just how it goes with things that are meant to fit a human head. As far as concept and build quality, it's better than anything I've tried to date. I'm waiting for some adapters to change the angle of the AVP knit strap, and I think after that, my search for what works for me will finally be over."
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Game changer for enabling multi-hour wearing. Makes the AVP truly usable for long sessions of spatial computing deep work and video meetings. No more face fatigue, face marks or perspiration. Can be used with or without light seal - without is best for long hours of work, with for immersive movie watching."
SRQ Fugate,5,"All these 1 star reviews, are from all the jealous poors. Butt hurt from too many combo meals, and looking in the mirror to often. Cant afford something that would require them to save money. Maybe not blow it all on meth and empty calories. Afford something nice, that wasn't stolen for a change."
willg97,5,Easily the best Vision Pro system. Combined with the 2x Solo Strap solution and setup was easy. New version pops on/off easily while feeling very secure. \n\nTook a couple minutes to find the best position but zero face pressure now and my head feels much lighter with the pressure more evenly distributed across the top/back. Thanks!
Jyles S.,3,Item is of god quality I understand it’s 3d printed so not too critical of that. Biggest flaw with open facing Vision Pro is that the bottom of the head set rests on the bridge of my nose and after prolonged use it begins to hurt a bit. I think I’ll stick to the light seal for now. I do like the idea of the open face concept and if think it surges more of a better AR experience.
Ganda,3,"The open face is definitely superior compared to using the light seal, but the seller should elaborate more about different sizes. I bought the standard one only to find the lenses is too close to the eyes and also because the arms moved closer to the display upon tightening. Upon asking for help, I was told about the larger size which he offered at a discount."
Nigel Arockiaraj,5,My wife boyfriend bought me this as a christmas gift and this was very good one. At night time I put on nice videos with lotion and get a lot of comfert very nice one. When the the 6'5 black man gave me lap dance I felt it.My wife left yesterday and i didnt even notice she left very good product very nice !!!!!!! Also I am black and like lady boys.
Duncan H,1,"My title says it all, probably the last Apple Product I buy, everything is locked to their ecosystem so there is such limited functionality it is sad. The marketing is extremely misleading the front facing LCD that displays your eyes is terrible quality. False advertising in my opinion, there will probably be a lawsuit."
Ronnie R.,5,"Good quality product. It works well to take pressure off your cheeks. I prefer the dual knit setup best, but this is a good alternative if you want to remove the light seal. I didn't find removing the light seal to be a major improvement and I prefer the immersive feel."
STEVEN N.,5,I am using the Dual solo knit band set up. Very comfortable. Works with and without light seal. although attaching the light seal a little finicky. I now prefer to use my AVP without the light seal. Extra bulk makes it more difficult to fit in my case.
Mike W.,5,Excellent seller! Extremely communicative and friendly. I was previously using a different bobo vr solution but ty’s is superior in comfort and usability. Highly recommend this open face product If you’re finding the Apple Vision Pro uncomfortable.
Bryan Williams,5,"Cool product and fair price for being able to do anything your mac or iPhone can do and more. Basically anything in the digital realm could be seen and heard realistically in your physical space!

People have no problem paying thousands of dollars for a Macbook or mac studio and this does even more and they haven't even scratched the surface yet!"
Derek C.,5,"Awesome accessory for the vision pro. I have the annapro headstrap and this is way better. Shipping was fast, and even came with spare parts which by no means was necessary, but greatly appreciated as I ended up needing after dropping and breaking a piece. 10/10 would buy again!"
mbsneider,5,"Really reduces the AVP’s weight and it’s more comfortable than the whole light seal pressing on your face. Might still want to use the light seal if watching a movie in an immersive environment, but otherwise it’s more comfortable with the open face system for general use. Recommended."
Neil J.,5,"Great product. Makes wearing the Vision Pro feel like nothing. Only negative I can tell is that it isn’t compatible with the light shield, but it is honestly better without. \n\nThe pad is a great, doesn’t leave a red mark on my head after wearing the headset from 100% to 0% which was crazy."
Carter Jackson,3,I feel like the people who give it 5 stars are people who work for apple and are trying to make the product look good. either way 3500 friggin dollars is a little pricey and over all just seemed kinda bad from the start. I have a feeling this is gonna go bad and there are gonna be some malfunctions and health care issues. And if not then well o well.
LiamGoose,5,"ok, I was skeptical about the price, but when I bought it I was greatly surprised. I was a homeless guy with nothing but $3499 to my name, I decided to pull the trigger and purchase the vision pro. When the vision pro arrived it saved my life, I was able to get a job, get a family, and my life went uphill.

Thanks Apple !!!"
Allen I.,5,"This is by far the most comfortable one in the entire market. I’ve tried literally literally every single one. .The solo knit adapters do not work for me. I had to use a different one that I purchased from someone else But outside of that, it’s incredible"
Eddie StL,5,"I love my Vision Pro. I got it about a week after launch, and to this day i use it daily. I’ve traveled with it a few times and i can no longer travel without it. While everyone has their tv screen on the plane, im fully immersed in a movie theatre thanks to Apple TV cinema mode. I can’t wait for VOS2"
Sigma Fanum,1,just get a quest 3. atleast you can play games on the quest 3. can’t even get games. you can literally do everything on the vision pro on a iphone. the quest 3 is like the vision pro but better in every way. apple needs to start actually making cheap products.
Constantine,5,"This is great. I personally use it with the dual strap setup, and the light seal still attached. It still works perfectly and I’m not suffering with the light splash and glare that comes without the light seal. Thank you!"
Inactive,4,"So far it's *almost* perfect. Unfortunately I do need ticker padding, so I'm re-using some from my PSVR2 globular-cluster. \n\nOther than that, the print quality is great, it doesn't look like a cheap print at all, and frankly the AVP looks sexier without the light seal anyways :)"
Nelson C.,5,"I think the open face pad is great and my only quibble is it may be too wide at the wing tips and not really sure if those should be outside the arms or tucked in. Overall it is so nice to lift the main AVP unit away from the cheeks and forehead to have it suspended over your eyes instead, and that achieves that full stop.\n\nFor the bobovr clips, just 2 suggestions:\n\n1) was my tolerances were pretty tight on mine so it does take a bit of force to pop them out from the AVP arms.\n\n2) It would be nice if they had just a teeny bit of padding inside (thin foam/felt/cushion) as when you combine the open face pad + the bobovr m1 plus/m3 mini it does lose the flex from the AVP arms and the whole thing becomes quite rigid, meaning that the adapter clips can rub up against the ...More"
Jerry,5,"This really does a lot to help with the AVP's weight. I can wear it for a lot longer now, and as a bonus the FOV is massively increased. Super great for productivity since i no longer feel like I'm wearing blinders. It feels more like you're wearing big glasses!"
Navan H.,3,Fast shipping. Taking on and off is difficult if you’re trying to switch between different use cases. Pad is uneven and falls off after use when adjusting. Overall still a good product and functions as intended.
mpmorgan83,5,"All looks as advertised! Really like new, as far as I can tell. Awesome. Thanks!!"
Jeff McMorris,5,I really like this headset mount. It makes the Vision Pro way more comfortable. I highly recommend it. It removes all pressure from your face. You can make it so it doesn’t even touch your face.
Izan Fayos,1,I mean I saw the vision of it but instead of buying weird Apple Pros and Apple products why not just buy regular Granny Smith Apples? Metallic taste and some woman named Siri kept on telling me not to put it in the oven to make Apple Pro Pie. Worst 3500 ever.
milkncrackas,4,"Ahead of its time. Huge potential for the future of computing, but the lack of early apps makes it difficult to give a 5 star review."
Miguel N.,4,"I’m pretty happy with the product and shipping process. It helps with better comfort that it is the key about it and the reason I think worth it.\n\nOn the other hand, IMHO, it is a bit expensive for a plastic printed, not a professional looking product, but, offering enough comfort solution to appreciate it."
John L.,5,"Absolutely awesome!! Made using my Vision Pro a joy for long periods of time. Really well made. Very clean, especially for something that was 3D printed. Really happy with my purchase"
Aaron T.,5,Good product. Good customer support. You can use the AVP without the light seal. The locking mechanism is now upgraded and Ty now provides extra XL size for the forehead support.
Kengine,5,"Works extremely well as described. The Vision Pro floats about your nose with the support being on your forehead. Would love to see a version with small blinders on the sides to reduce light leak glare, but still works great."
Kelly Kasik,5,"I took the demo at the Apple Store and walked out with a new Vision Pro. WOW, amazing. Everything from the photos, movies, apps this product was amazing. I want to go to Mt. Hood in Oregon now. Give it a try!!!!"
SuperFlame KB,1,"Bro Apple's actually crazy. Steve Jobs really wants us to buy this stinkin' MetaQuest 2 and 3 rip-off for like 4 grand. Bro, I could literally buy a multiple flights around the world for this. DO NOT BUY"
Devin,5,I have an oculus quest at home with hand tracking which is good. I went to try this at apple store and it has eye tracking too. Everything is so realistic. I would definitely buy it if it wasn't 4000 DOLLARS
Mike Orren,4,"Sure, it's heavy. And it doesn't fulfill every single dream every single customer had.

It's still indistinguishable from magic. And gets better each day."
makr mania,5,"awesome! I actually bought it, unlike the broke people commenting here. truly revolutionary. A great first product that shows where computing can and will go"
Doreen Aziz,1,"Way way too much money not enough apps extremely. Heavy head set meta quest.
 Right now is your way to go. Sorry , apple Also does not respond when it is too dark"
Will at Hilldrup Rawls,1,commercials looked awesome. i'm sure the product doesn't disappoint. now we wait for v. 3.0 where it's affordable to everyday individuals and not strictly for corporate use (or the very wealthy)
AHA,5,"It costs 3500 usd, that's like 86161250.00. You cannot even get one in Vietnam. You have to fly to USA to get one. Which costs $1000. Do not buy one of these!"
AlphaNeon,1,"What's the point of this headset in the first place? To play games? To be a private web browser on your face?

What is the point?"
Brandon H.,5,It makes the AVP feel like it’s significantly lighter. Almost as comfortable as a Valve Index. And that’s a huge compliment. Great design!
Nino,5,"The components are of quality and the fit and functionality are amazing. Totally worth owning if you're an AVP owner, this has made viewing content lying down so much more comfortable, taking all of the weight off of your face."
Vamsi Karnati,1,"How can we record a video or some training if we want to, maybe if not allowed to record on App. In real scenario we can use a phone to record, but how with this googles...... VERY FUNNY SCHEMES...GOOD LUCK SELLING."
Egg,1,I was driving with the vision pros on and the battery ended up dyeing which caused the entire screen to go black. THIS DEVICE ALMOST KILLED ME. DONT DRIVE WITH THEM
Douglas N.,5,Nice quality Apple Vision Pro 3d printed support. Easily assembled. Great instructions. Printed and shipped promptly.
Jas,3,"The velcro barely sticks, and the connector of the forehead wears out after a couple of times and will slip out of the socket. The idea is very good and does work, but the quality could be better."
Finland Six,1,"The vision pro is a no-go, I'd highly discourage anyone from buying this product and checking out any of the other VR headsets available for a fraction of the price. Will be seeking refund"
Robert,5,Works as it should. Keeps my AVP off my face comfortably. Very easy to construct. Very clever and well made.
Eliot G.,5,Incredible upgrade that adds comfort and functionality to the Vision Pro. Thoughtfully engineered and well produced. A great value too!
Akoni A.,5,"The Velcro to attach the padding could be better, but that’s the only improvement that could be made to this product. 5/5 overall. Great job!"
Owen Yang,5,"This is going to be a massive leap for the tech industry, I think that the price is a little bit overpriced. But once the consumer version comes out it will be a big jump"
razmtaz1987,5,Works great! Definitely makes the AVP more tolerable to wear. Amazing Apple didn't do something like this built into the light bands.
Sign in with Apple user,5,Went from only being able to wear my AVP comfortably for around 30 minutes to no pain at all for two hours straight. This is a must buy for anyone who has an AVP that is sensitive to face pressure.
Scott R.,5,Buy from this guy if you want the highest quality designs that just work! His reviews and products speak for themself! Highly recommend!
SS Shack,1,"The apple vision pro is way too expensive for its features and it has multiple glitches, also you can barely interact with family and call others when using the vision pro since it is an artificial version of the person."
T. W.,5,This open face system does a surprisingly competent job of comfortably redistributing the weight. Great alternate to the light seal!
C K.,5,This item is allowing me to finally enjoy using my Apple Vision Pro. No more heavy weight pressing on my abused sinuses. Thank you!
Trevon B.,5,I installed mine upside down and it feels better for me. Takes the pressure off your cheeks and makes wearing this without the light seal game changer.
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Excellent item. Gets the weight of the VP off your face entirely. I cut the edges of the pad down, so I can use it with or without the light shield."
Anthony Tran,5,"When i first tried out the headset, I was honestly surprised with how well the device worked for me and i feel like this headset will be good for anyone to use if you can afford it, however the headset is heavy and may require a bit of time to get used to when you first try it out."
Abhishek Sen,5,"100%, for sure, anytime of the day, without a doubt, no question, easy choice, for sure ponder it, would pay a bil, worth every penny, the best, dont even not think about it, best investment, worth the buck, the dollar, the cent, buy it, youll be happy, yolo"
Penelope Seagrave,5,This is an incredible product that transports you into a magical experience for both focused productivity and surreal media consumption.
Andre Jamal,1,"I think its super cool, but the price is not meant for the everyday worker so until then, forget the Apple Pro Vision, we going to continue our quest."
Nick Greiner,5,Incredible product. Apple’s most exciting launch since the iPhone in 2007.
Demons General,5,This is something thats gonna change the way we interact with everything... This is gonna do what first smartphone did to telephone probably more..
James F.,5,"Beautiful filament used on this lightweight 3D printed stand, which perfectly holds my Vision Pro. Highly recommend!"
Paul D.,5,Exactly as described and shown in the photos. Very well designed and printed. Trust it to hold my AVP and battery.
Richard S.,5,Really does make the headset more comfortable. Great with no lightshield and also fits with a size 22W lightshield.
Lisa S.,5,I️ recommend this item every day to people I️nSpaze. It has been great for using the Apple Vision Pro comfortably for hours and hours.
Zach,5,This accessory increases FOV substantially and is more comfortable to wear.\nGreat communication from TY\nI would highly recommend his store
Salvatore M.,5,don't hesitate! great seller! great product! fast shipping!
awwwee,1,Buy an oculus instead. It's 20x cheaper and just much better in general. Don't waste your bread.
Salim Riley,5,Apple is making a big step in the right direction with this one. It’s a crazy time to be alive.
myshipmyrules,5,I use my Vision Pro in passthrough most of the time. Using this brings it closer to feeling like super high end AR glasses and I love it.
Joshua Thomas,5,"When I put on the apple vision pro headset, I felt like a new world has opened to me. I wish I wanted to wear it more, but I need to earn money in order to buy that headset."
FlyOnTheWallflower,1,i see people say stuff about the price and yeah i get it basically a meta quest 2 wish version so if apple could just lower the price a bit then i can see this getting 4 or 5 stars
synstelien,5,Great! Well designed and very comfortable. Fits and works with the light seal as well.
Paul,5,I’ve tried many third-party vision pro adapters and straps. This one is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use.
Aaron C.,5,"Great build quality, easy instructions and it’s super duper comfortable now. Really awesome stuff."
Austin J.,5,I use this every time! Way better for AVP to be like glasses instead of goggles. Thanks!
tervrt g,1,this is expensive a fake Meta Quest 3 off brand you are losing money I can download a Meta Quest is easy but the Apple Vision Pro needs a computer this is rigged
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Amazing product, made the Apple Vision Pro both more usable and more comfortable. Well worth the price."
Dan,5,I ordered from 3 suppliers on Etsy and this unit was by far the best. The other units were so so. This one was fantastic.
Noel B.,5,"Works great and love having the open face design. Ever since using the quest pro, this is a must for any headset I use now."
gary Fine,5,Perhaps Apple should lease this product like cars with a trade in value after 1 year so long as it still functions properly.
Anshu K.,5,The vision pro is amazing.Encounter dinosaurs is real.I won't spoil it anymore but try it.Five stars.

Cameron Oelsen,5,"For those who are able to afford it, it is an awesome product for content consumption and work."
Nate Johnson,1,"All of apple's stuff is so expensive, you could buy a really high end pc with a good vr headset for $4,000"
Kevin S.,5,"Better than the similar Infinity One forehead rest, as this one can adjust to different forehead angles"
Retro Misfit,1,"Please don't waste money on this, just buy 6 quests for this price tag. Seriously, it's not worth it."
Noah Novak,1,get groceries instead or pay a house loan something instead of this goofy ahh eye bra :(((
Jake L,1,"super heavy product I don't really love it, it looks fascinating though"

Greg C.,5,Love the item! Super comfortable. Seller had an issue with his supplier that delayed delivery but was so helpful and went out of his way to speed delivery to make up for it. I couldn’t be happier with both the product and the level of customer service.
Brendan Jarmusz,5,"much better once you use it yourself, miles ahead of any other headset on the market"
Mr Sprinter,1,Are you seriously going to spend 3500 dollars for this? Go buy a Metaquest.
Blah,5,Makes using AVP even more comfortable. Works exactly as described.
Scott msa,1,The idea of life is to get out and live it. Not imagine it and live it through goggles.
Sign in with Apple user,5,"I wasn’t familiar with the open face system, but this product was a great introduction to it."

Kevin Fuller,3,"The Apple Vision Pro is extremely innovative; there's no doubt about that. Watching movies, looking at old photos and/or videos, and playing the immersive games on the AVP are breathtaking. Seriously, those features on this headset are out of this world good and no other headset can replicate that experience at the moment. 

The ""passthrough"" feature is meh at best. I was able to walk around my college campus pretty well with these on. However, I made sure not to walk too fast as there's some latency with it. The FOV is pretty limited and I often found myself needing to check my surroundings quite often as you basically lose most if not all your peripheral vision when you put these on. Also, using my Apple Watch while wearing the AVP was very difficult as the text on the ...More"
Joseph Scroggins,2,"I have owned this device from the launch and I am beyond disappointed with apple. We are almost 6 months into the launch and it still feels like I am working with a BETA device/software. 

The apps on this device are VERY limited. You can't even arrange the apps on the home screen for easier use... they are just placed in alphabetical order and limited to a small amount per-page. Apple touts that it now has 1000+ apps for it, but majority of them are trash and useless. Apple didn't even have its own native apps available at first. Most of them are there now, but they don't operate to full capacity. It's definitely not like having a computer at your finger tips, it operates more like an iPad. I'm sorry, but I need more functionality for most of the things that I am doing and ...More"
Tyler Haupt,5,"Never before was there a more expensive way to experience the Allegorical Cave! 
I would like to thank the Apple Team for not only delivering on their promise to disconnect me further and further from the world, but also for allowing me to segment myself from society for the purposes of marketing. I hope my biometric, internet, and personal data is well utilized by the Apple Team so that they can best manipulate shadows in optimal patterns allowing me to cease all manor of individual thought and finally become a being of instinct and routine behaviors. Please continue to drip feed me the illusion of happiness through complacency so that the world will never need to challenge me ever again.

Sideboard,5,"If you like high-tech cutting-edge experiences, this is a product for you. Nothing else in the world offers this level of immersion and visual quality in a headset this lightweight and well-crafted. This is the Mona Lisa of Virtual Reality Headsets. You have to use Apple apps, not everything is available yet, but as a legitimate computing platform, software comes second to hardware. The haters of this product have no legs to stand on, as they have never even tried it out. Once you put on the headset, you are instantly aware that the future goes one of two ways: Immersive Mixed Reality Computing, or Heads-Up Display Augmented Reality. The Apple Vision Pro is a glimpse into one of our potential high-tech futures and I can't wait to watch the immersive shows that will be coming ...More"
James DeRose,4,"Absolutely love my Vision Pro. I was in the process of buying a new laptop (Currently own an M1 Pro) and planning on getting an M3. I wanted to know if the Vision pro could legitimately be used as a new computer? Yes and no. I would not sell my M1 as I use the Vision Pro as my second screen. There is a hefty cost to it, but lots of capabilities and more I am sure will come. There rarely are any Apple products that are ""cheap"" so it's tough when people say its way too expensive. I would suggest checking one out before buying it, but Apple definitely did a great job with this product and I am sure it will get better in the future. I have experienced minor bugs, but nothing crazy. Pros: Awesome display, great setup and compatibility. Cons: Price, touch sensitivity on occasion ...More"
Michael Min,5,"This is going to be a awesome product. It is meant for older people, so you should not buy it for your kid. However, it is a great product when you are bored of the outside. Also, this product is peasant money; anybody can buy this without breaking the bank. It can be pricey for some people, but overall Apple is going to make a fortune off this product. For example, Apple is making a lot of money off their stuff. So, this will make them even more money for the company. When this comes out, I am buying this thing no matter what! Lets go over the basics: One, the oculus battery dies out fast! I played it for 30 min, and my battery died. I feel like this battery is better than the other one. Two, why would apple just release this thing for the world of it. This product is going ...More"
Alexander G.,2,"The manufacturer seems like a nice person, but this thing is really such a disappointment. \n\n– The L/R tabs were of different tightnesses, the left side being too loose. \n– The velcro/pad are a total mismatch. The pad can slip off the forehead plate very very easily; try to make an adjustment and it'll likely slide. So you need to take the whole vision off and reset the positioning. \n– The velcro pad and the forehead plate are not sized to match. The pad's wings jut out the sides, plate's corners peek through top. \n– Adjustability is bare minimum. Can't change the angle at which the plate is held, and you can't hold the plate at a particular angle either–– it just sets into path of least resistance. Can't adjust the vertical distance of the plate. \n\nAllows open face ...More"
Guy C.,5,"Wow! This really works. I got the Basic Open Face System For the Apple Vision Pro and it REALLY helps with comfort. The included pad is very soft and the strap allows all the weight to be transferred to the forehead, eliminating the pressure on the face. It makes the Vision Pro feel lighter. (Actually, it is lighter without the light seal assembly). It is easy to put together and remove too. A few notes - the pad can be a bit difficult to get attached, though a slight flex of the plastic and wiggling of the pad gets it to secure better. The Vision Pro may also now alert you to the display being too close when you first put it on. Having the lenses closer does increase the FOV, though be careful if you walk around and bump something, since the lenses are closer to your eyes. I ...More"
Niranjan Bhat,5,"The transparent VR glass, eye & hand click are really from another level. You can see people automatically when you required!, AI will detect people. Quest 3 is better for games, but Vision pro experience as a professional & as a daily life is better. 
Main distinguish is other people can see your eyes, so you can talk without taking off everytime. 
Another big accomplishment is Real Avatar, Unlike quest 3 where you appear some funny animals, here in Vision pro, you actually look same as you! means live track your face and make 3D face avatar in real time and you can do facetime or walk through in the metaverse and meet your friends, You don't have to read your friend name on the avatar. Because you immediately recognize them and nobody looks funny avatars"
Brian Hernandez,1,"What is this supposed to be? It's front heavy VR headset. Please remove those goofy eyes from the front on the headset and either add a battery to the headset or have a battery with a removeable cable, as do you know how annoying the battery is with an attached cable. Not a lot of third party apps but I'm sure that will improve with time. No YouTube or Netflix thus alienates a good chunk unless you go through the browser. I understand the the metal on the front is to show off quality but it really adds to the front heaviness and while short term it's fine but long term its annoying. I can't justify this price because it doesn't have much of a use case and everyone is laughing at you when they see the eyes and not that I care much but the eyes on front look nothing like in the ...More"
Sign in with Apple user,5,"I came across this on Reddit and was very interested to see if it would work as well as advertised. I just received it, and let me tell you, it works extremely well. Does what it's supposed to. The FOV is greatly increased and absolutely no pressure on my cheeks, even with the solo strap. Also, in case anyone who uses the Zeiss lenses is wondering, this does work with them flawlessly. I did get the ""eyes too close,"" but I just dismiss the warning and smooth sailing from there. Will still use the light seal for movies but I can't ignore how much less isolated I feel while wearing. 5 stars all around."
Dom Meyer,4,"This may work well for many, but it works very poorly for my facial shape. It's impossible to keep the Vision Pro far enough from my eyes and nose while using this. Even when set at the furthest length, the open face system attachments slide away, causing the distance to drop and the Vision Pro to press against my nose. I've resorted to wrapping rubber bands around the Vision Pro arms to prevent this slipping, but even then the device is too close. Based on other reviews, it seems that this does work well for many face and head shapes, but if you have a big nose or more angular structure, this might not work well for you."
Niles,5,"All I can say is wow. I am a day one Vision Pro owner and I have tried most of the solutions to try to make it more comfortable. This forehead cushion is far and away the most ideal solution, and easily the most comfortable. It’s so easy to install, and it allows for very easy adjustments. The cushion is really high-quality as well. I have always struggled With the Vision Pro leaning on my nose, bridge, but this completely fixes the issue and allows me to use the headset without the light seal. Top-tier product!"
Nicholas C.,5,Spoke with the seller a day before I placed my order he responded quickly so I ordered and when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It’s obviously not something you would buy from the store quality as it’s 3D printed but the craftsmanship is really really good so no complaints. Just wanted to point that out for the really picky people. The unit is easily installed and works perfectly. The seller also included a QR code that links to how to install the unit. The instructions are easily followed. This is really cool and gives you a new way to enjoy the Apple Vision Pro.
Avesh J.,5,This thing has been a total game changer for my Apple Vision Pro. I was getting a little bummed out by all the pressure on my face when using the device. This thing has completely solved the problem and allows me to use the AVP for longer periods of time with no discomfort. The extra peripheral vision without the light seal is incredible and enhances the overall experience. I haven't used the light seal at all since I started using this. This really gets me excited about the possibilities with the AVP.
rmhall,5,"The Open Face System is a game changer for me. It makes wearing the Vision Pro so much more comfortable and makes the solo strap more functional without having to crank down the tightness. Now I can easily use it with or without the light shield as well, which has some great use cases. A must have purchase, and one, if not the best of the Vision Pro accessories I've picked up so far. I've had it for a few weeks now, and it is indispensable. Plenty of room for customization and tweaking too. Highly recommended!"
Paul D.,5,"I receieved exactly what was described. The adapters slide onto the AVP arms and the top pad snaps in and can be removed easily. The adapters don't have to be removed to go back to using the light shield. This is how Apple should have shipped the AVP. Without the light shield, it is basically like wearing a weightless pair of sunglasses and a hat. You can see out the sides for situational awareness. Good product, good value, good communication from seller and good shipping."
Jade Dumlao,1,"Ok, apple, if you think im spending 3500 bucks on a meta quest 2 ripoff, hell to the naw. Lets look at the comparisons, shall we?

The meta quest 2 and 3 can also do hand tracking.
They can also call phones and stuff
Be my guest if you wanna spend that much money on a gyatt dam headset
So, in conclusion, i dont think it should cost that much. Its insane. It should be like, 590 bucks or somethin i dont care if you spent 16 years on it. IT SHOULDNT BE THAT EXPENSIVE"
etsy.com Shopper,5,This thing is absolutely perfect. The cushion used along with the plastic allows it to flex a little bit over the top of your head - so it really doesn't apply much pressure (unlike the original Quest Pro design which was too hard. \n\nI was already modding the default configuration of the Vision Pro to make it more comfortable - and now this will be how I use it daily with the exception of using the interface while on flights. \n\nIf you're second guessing a purchase - do not hesitate. This turns the Vision Pro from something I could use for an hour at a time to ALL DAY (if I weren't married lol.)
Andrew R,2,"Innovative and love the idea however I priced mine out and with lenses, it will be 
 Apple Card Monthly Installments
$333.16/mo.per month for 12 months.
$3,998.00 Total
Price includes ZEISS Optical Inserts

I have better things to spend $4k on right now. 

Like the iPads and other Apple products Prices will come down in a couple of years once competitors come out. Right now the 1% and DIe hard techies will be buying these."
Vlad Chogoleff,1,"the product is truly amazing, the quality of the build, the picture quality, the apple ecosystem, but with 2 apps/videos available there is absolutly nothing to experience. The safari crashing like 30 times a day, the multi windows is getting blury, the lenses has a halo, the headset just simply doesn't work in a dark, and lastly the see thru quality is poor. I simply returned it, because after 2 days of playing it's start laying down on a couch and the $25/month applecare+ subscription won't help at all. Hope apple will come up with more content in a few years with a more reasonable price tag."
Rick Lay,3,"The clips don’t stay in place and slide forward. The AVP keeps telling me my eyes are too close to the lenses with and without inserts. When initially put on it is comfortable, but it does not stay in place. I’m concerned that after multiple installs and uninstalls, it will wear...I would have preferred the versions where the arms needed to be removed. It's probably safer. It may work for some people depending on the positioning and head size, but it not right for my big head. Took almost 2 weeks to arrive (because of the pad)."
Scott R.,5,This new stand is fantastic. Its sleek design is shaped to contour to the Vision Pro perfectly. I love this marble material option as it goes great with the black and white esthetics of the AVP. \n\nIt also works great with the new face shield provided separately from the same company. It alleviates some of the pressure from the face but also works with and without the Apple light leak shield. \n\nI highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed.
Cole Klingler,5,"Innovative product that increases efficiency. I highly recommend, the price tag is a burden but remember Apple allows credit monthly payment plans. Be sure to tell your cooperate supervisor that the apple eco system will promote a cutting edge solution that is corporate fatigue. Apple Vison Pro has a partnership with ""ZEISS"" Carl Zeiss AG is a swiss company known for their craftsmanship and high precession instruments that meet the demand of todays problems in all forms of sectors."
William T.,5,"Honestly, a game changer. I initially had the Vision Pro too close to my face, but after moving it back as far as possible, everything just felt right. It’s SO much more comfortable without the light shield. \n\nOnly complaint is the shield does not slide in easily, though I assume that’s to prevent it from falling out. The overall feel is fantastic, and it’s very easy to switch back. And everything still fits in my case."
Spring Complete,5,I really like it. It is better than the Quest 3 and has stunning visuals. Nothing quite as stunning as watching a movie in there with the equivalent of a 200 inch screen. And i can get quite a bit of work there done too with all the windows on display and easy accessibility. Only real complaint is the power situation which with the brick is not gracefully managed and the battery life being short.
Shaurya Tomar,2,"Great idea, I hope that Apple implements it well and this device actually becomes a productive device which can be seen in modern work-spaces.
But, just like every other Apple product, the price of this product is also through the roof. I would have appreciated even if apple sold this for 2000 USD. If 3500 USD is the cost of the first generation, I can do nothing but sink in sorrow when I think of the price of the next generations."
Vlary N.,5,It does exactly what it is intended to do. Now I can finally enjoy AVP for long periods of time. The only problem I have is the Velcro. It’s pretty weak and doesn’t stay on plastic especially when I adjust the plastic piece it disconnects. Solution is to just glue it or get a better one from Michael’s or something. I think it may not work for everyone bc of head size and hair. But it’s worth a try for 40$ or so
Laughter Centralize,1,"A month later! and my 600 dollar oculus is still more useful. Id feel better IF I SPENT 4k DOLLARS ON THE OCULUS!!!! All that 8k video! Picture! USELESSSSSSSSSS! I rather use my phone! Its a big iPhone on your face! 1 day of having, you watch some youtube, play cut the rope and get bored! By 3 days of using this you wont want to use it anymore"
Kenneth K.,5,"The seller went above and beyond and even threw in some free stuff. The quality of the product is amazing. It’s exactly what I was looking for and believe me I tried so many different printers and brands. And no, not all 3d prints are the same. Designs quality of materials even the way they print it all differs quite a bit. You get what you pay for. This is indeed the best out there."
Brenden Lane,5,wow it was so fun and good to use. the radiation in my eyes goes away after a few days. But I think there was a side affect. I can now breath colors and see in the dark. oh but at least I can now watch skibidi toilit in AR! which is a majore plus. over all very good product. however money is to big for sigma males as myself. ;)
Kane,5,"There are a number of different mods being created to make the Vision Pro headset more comfortable, I've tried a few and the open face design by TycoTech is by far the best one I've tried to date. It's easy to install/remove in less than a minute, so you can switch between the open face or the standard light shield setup depending on your preference. The open face design also distributes the weight off my cheeks making it more comfortable to wear for longer periods."
Jean-Denis H.,5,"Got mine yesterday (v2) and I tried it out today for 2 hours and it’s been GREAT. Installation was very straightforward (v3 looks even better), peripheral vision was great, very comfortable with nothing touching your face except your forehead. The controls worked perfectly as well. Glad to know that extra pads will be purchasable, that way I’ll have a “work” one and one or two “exercise” ones."
J S.,5,"This strap is REMARKABLE!! I feel zero pressure wearing my Vision Pro sitting, standing, or laying down. The two small clips included with the strap also help keep it in place and not slide. I've tried all sorts of comfort straps before (Annapro, AirCover, etc.) and none of them even come close to the level of comfort that this strap provides. I'm beyond impressed!"
Ozzie B.,5,"This is almost perfect for me. I won't ding it any stars, because it could be 100% perfect for someone else. That's just how it goes with things that are meant to fit a human head. As far as concept and build quality, it's better than anything I've tried to date. I'm waiting for some adapters to change the angle of the AVP knit strap, and I think after that, my search for what works for me will finally be over."
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Game changer for enabling multi-hour wearing. Makes the AVP truly usable for long sessions of spatial computing deep work and video meetings. No more face fatigue, face marks or perspiration. Can be used with or without light seal - without is best for long hours of work, with for immersive movie watching."
SRQ Fugate,5,"All these 1 star reviews, are from all the jealous poors. Butt hurt from too many combo meals, and looking in the mirror to often. Cant afford something that would require them to save money. Maybe not blow it all on meth and empty calories. Afford something nice, that wasn't stolen for a change."
willg97,5,Easily the best Vision Pro system. Combined with the 2x Solo Strap solution and setup was easy. New version pops on/off easily while feeling very secure. \n\nTook a couple minutes to find the best position but zero face pressure now and my head feels much lighter with the pressure more evenly distributed across the top/back. Thanks!
Jyles S.,3,Item is of god quality I understand it’s 3d printed so not too critical of that. Biggest flaw with open facing Vision Pro is that the bottom of the head set rests on the bridge of my nose and after prolonged use it begins to hurt a bit. I think I’ll stick to the light seal for now. I do like the idea of the open face concept and if think it surges more of a better AR experience.
Ganda,3,"The open face is definitely superior compared to using the light seal, but the seller should elaborate more about different sizes. I bought the standard one only to find the lenses is too close to the eyes and also because the arms moved closer to the display upon tightening. Upon asking for help, I was told about the larger size which he offered at a discount."
Nigel Arockiaraj,5,My wife boyfriend bought me this as a christmas gift and this was very good one. At night time I put on nice videos with lotion and get a lot of comfert very nice one. When the the 6'5 black man gave me lap dance I felt it.My wife left yesterday and i didnt even notice she left very good product very nice !!!!!!! Also I am black and like lady boys.
Duncan H,1,"My title says it all, probably the last Apple Product I buy, everything is locked to their ecosystem so there is such limited functionality it is sad. The marketing is extremely misleading the front facing LCD that displays your eyes is terrible quality. False advertising in my opinion, there will probably be a lawsuit."
Ronnie R.,5,"Good quality product. It works well to take pressure off your cheeks. I prefer the dual knit setup best, but this is a good alternative if you want to remove the light seal. I didn't find removing the light seal to be a major improvement and I prefer the immersive feel."
STEVEN N.,5,I am using the Dual solo knit band set up. Very comfortable. Works with and without light seal. although attaching the light seal a little finicky. I now prefer to use my AVP without the light seal. Extra bulk makes it more difficult to fit in my case.
Mike W.,5,Excellent seller! Extremely communicative and friendly. I was previously using a different bobo vr solution but ty’s is superior in comfort and usability. Highly recommend this open face product If you’re finding the Apple Vision Pro uncomfortable.
Bryan Williams,5,"Cool product and fair price for being able to do anything your mac or iPhone can do and more. Basically anything in the digital realm could be seen and heard realistically in your physical space!

People have no problem paying thousands of dollars for a Macbook or mac studio and this does even more and they haven't even scratched the surface yet!"
Derek C.,5,"Awesome accessory for the vision pro. I have the annapro headstrap and this is way better. Shipping was fast, and even came with spare parts which by no means was necessary, but greatly appreciated as I ended up needing after dropping and breaking a piece. 10/10 would buy again!"
mbsneider,5,"Really reduces the AVP’s weight and it’s more comfortable than the whole light seal pressing on your face. Might still want to use the light seal if watching a movie in an immersive environment, but otherwise it’s more comfortable with the open face system for general use. Recommended."
Neil J.,5,"Great product. Makes wearing the Vision Pro feel like nothing. Only negative I can tell is that it isn’t compatible with the light shield, but it is honestly better without. \n\nThe pad is a great, doesn’t leave a red mark on my head after wearing the headset from 100% to 0% which was crazy."
Carter Jackson,3,I feel like the people who give it 5 stars are people who work for apple and are trying to make the product look good. either way 3500 friggin dollars is a little pricey and over all just seemed kinda bad from the start. I have a feeling this is gonna go bad and there are gonna be some malfunctions and health care issues. And if not then well o well.
LiamGoose,5,"ok, I was skeptical about the price, but when I bought it I was greatly surprised. I was a homeless guy with nothing but $3499 to my name, I decided to pull the trigger and purchase the vision pro. When the vision pro arrived it saved my life, I was able to get a job, get a family, and my life went uphill.

Thanks Apple !!!"
Allen I.,5,"This is by far the most comfortable one in the entire market. I’ve tried literally literally every single one. .The solo knit adapters do not work for me. I had to use a different one that I purchased from someone else But outside of that, it’s incredible"
Eddie StL,5,"I love my Vision Pro. I got it about a week after launch, and to this day i use it daily. I’ve traveled with it a few times and i can no longer travel without it. While everyone has their tv screen on the plane, im fully immersed in a movie theatre thanks to Apple TV cinema mode. I can’t wait for VOS2"
Sigma Fanum,1,just get a quest 3. atleast you can play games on the quest 3. can’t even get games. you can literally do everything on the vision pro on a iphone. the quest 3 is like the vision pro but better in every way. apple needs to start actually making cheap products.
Constantine,5,"This is great. I personally use it with the dual strap setup, and the light seal still attached. It still works perfectly and I’m not suffering with the light splash and glare that comes without the light seal. Thank you!"
Inactive,4,"So far it's *almost* perfect. Unfortunately I do need ticker padding, so I'm re-using some from my PSVR2 globular-cluster. \n\nOther than that, the print quality is great, it doesn't look like a cheap print at all, and frankly the AVP looks sexier without the light seal anyways :)"
Nelson C.,5,"I think the open face pad is great and my only quibble is it may be too wide at the wing tips and not really sure if those should be outside the arms or tucked in. Overall it is so nice to lift the main AVP unit away from the cheeks and forehead to have it suspended over your eyes instead, and that achieves that full stop.\n\nFor the bobovr clips, just 2 suggestions:\n\n1) was my tolerances were pretty tight on mine so it does take a bit of force to pop them out from the AVP arms.\n\n2) It would be nice if they had just a teeny bit of padding inside (thin foam/felt/cushion) as when you combine the open face pad + the bobovr m1 plus/m3 mini it does lose the flex from the AVP arms and the whole thing becomes quite rigid, meaning that the adapter clips can rub up against the ...More"
Jerry,5,"This really does a lot to help with the AVP's weight. I can wear it for a lot longer now, and as a bonus the FOV is massively increased. Super great for productivity since i no longer feel like I'm wearing blinders. It feels more like you're wearing big glasses!"
Navan H.,3,Fast shipping. Taking on and off is difficult if you’re trying to switch between different use cases. Pad is uneven and falls off after use when adjusting. Overall still a good product and functions as intended.
mpmorgan83,5,"All looks as advertised! Really like new, as far as I can tell. Awesome. Thanks!!"
Jeff McMorris,5,I really like this headset mount. It makes the Vision Pro way more comfortable. I highly recommend it. It removes all pressure from your face. You can make it so it doesn’t even touch your face.
Izan Fayos,1,I mean I saw the vision of it but instead of buying weird Apple Pros and Apple products why not just buy regular Granny Smith Apples? Metallic taste and some woman named Siri kept on telling me not to put it in the oven to make Apple Pro Pie. Worst 3500 ever.
milkncrackas,4,"Ahead of its time. Huge potential for the future of computing, but the lack of early apps makes it difficult to give a 5 star review."
Miguel N.,4,"I’m pretty happy with the product and shipping process. It helps with better comfort that it is the key about it and the reason I think worth it.\n\nOn the other hand, IMHO, it is a bit expensive for a plastic printed, not a professional looking product, but, offering enough comfort solution to appreciate it."
John L.,5,"Absolutely awesome!! Made using my Vision Pro a joy for long periods of time. Really well made. Very clean, especially for something that was 3D printed. Really happy with my purchase"
Aaron T.,5,Good product. Good customer support. You can use the AVP without the light seal. The locking mechanism is now upgraded and Ty now provides extra XL size for the forehead support.
Kengine,5,"Works extremely well as described. The Vision Pro floats about your nose with the support being on your forehead. Would love to see a version with small blinders on the sides to reduce light leak glare, but still works great."
Kelly Kasik,5,"I took the demo at the Apple Store and walked out with a new Vision Pro. WOW, amazing. Everything from the photos, movies, apps this product was amazing. I want to go to Mt. Hood in Oregon now. Give it a try!!!!"
SuperFlame KB,1,"Bro Apple's actually crazy. Steve Jobs really wants us to buy this stinkin' MetaQuest 2 and 3 rip-off for like 4 grand. Bro, I could literally buy a multiple flights around the world for this. DO NOT BUY"
Devin,5,I have an oculus quest at home with hand tracking which is good. I went to try this at apple store and it has eye tracking too. Everything is so realistic. I would definitely buy it if it wasn't 4000 DOLLARS
Mike Orren,4,"Sure, it's heavy. And it doesn't fulfill every single dream every single customer had.

It's still indistinguishable from magic. And gets better each day."
makr mania,5,"awesome! I actually bought it, unlike the broke people commenting here. truly revolutionary. A great first product that shows where computing can and will go"
Doreen Aziz,1,"Way way too much money not enough apps extremely. Heavy head set meta quest.
 Right now is your way to go. Sorry , apple Also does not respond when it is too dark"
Will at Hilldrup Rawls,1,commercials looked awesome. i'm sure the product doesn't disappoint. now we wait for v. 3.0 where it's affordable to everyday individuals and not strictly for corporate use (or the very wealthy)
AHA,5,"It costs 3500 usd, that's like 86161250.00. You cannot even get one in Vietnam. You have to fly to USA to get one. Which costs $1000. Do not buy one of these!"
AlphaNeon,1,"What's the point of this headset in the first place? To play games? To be a private web browser on your face?

What is the point?"
Brandon H.,5,It makes the AVP feel like it’s significantly lighter. Almost as comfortable as a Valve Index. And that’s a huge compliment. Great design!
Nino,5,"The components are of quality and the fit and functionality are amazing. Totally worth owning if you're an AVP owner, this has made viewing content lying down so much more comfortable, taking all of the weight off of your face."
Vamsi Karnati,1,"How can we record a video or some training if we want to, maybe if not allowed to record on App. In real scenario we can use a phone to record, but how with this googles...... VERY FUNNY SCHEMES...GOOD LUCK SELLING."
Egg,1,I was driving with the vision pros on and the battery ended up dyeing which caused the entire screen to go black. THIS DEVICE ALMOST KILLED ME. DONT DRIVE WITH THEM
Douglas N.,5,Nice quality Apple Vision Pro 3d printed support. Easily assembled. Great instructions. Printed and shipped promptly.
Jas,3,"The velcro barely sticks, and the connector of the forehead wears out after a couple of times and will slip out of the socket. The idea is very good and does work, but the quality could be better."
Finland Six,1,"The vision pro is a no-go, I'd highly discourage anyone from buying this product and checking out any of the other VR headsets available for a fraction of the price. Will be seeking refund"
Robert,5,Works as it should. Keeps my AVP off my face comfortably. Very easy to construct. Very clever and well made.
Eliot G.,5,Incredible upgrade that adds comfort and functionality to the Vision Pro. Thoughtfully engineered and well produced. A great value too!
Akoni A.,5,"The Velcro to attach the padding could be better, but that’s the only improvement that could be made to this product. 5/5 overall. Great job!"
Owen Yang,5,"This is going to be a massive leap for the tech industry, I think that the price is a little bit overpriced. But once the consumer version comes out it will be a big jump"
razmtaz1987,5,Works great! Definitely makes the AVP more tolerable to wear. Amazing Apple didn't do something like this built into the light bands.
Sign in with Apple user,5,Went from only being able to wear my AVP comfortably for around 30 minutes to no pain at all for two hours straight. This is a must buy for anyone who has an AVP that is sensitive to face pressure.
Scott R.,5,Buy from this guy if you want the highest quality designs that just work! His reviews and products speak for themself! Highly recommend!
SS Shack,1,"The apple vision pro is way too expensive for its features and it has multiple glitches, also you can barely interact with family and call others when using the vision pro since it is an artificial version of the person."
T. W.,5,This open face system does a surprisingly competent job of comfortably redistributing the weight. Great alternate to the light seal!
C K.,5,This item is allowing me to finally enjoy using my Apple Vision Pro. No more heavy weight pressing on my abused sinuses. Thank you!
Trevon B.,5,I installed mine upside down and it feels better for me. Takes the pressure off your cheeks and makes wearing this without the light seal game changer.
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Excellent item. Gets the weight of the VP off your face entirely. I cut the edges of the pad down, so I can use it with or without the light shield."
Anthony Tran,5,"When i first tried out the headset, I was honestly surprised with how well the device worked for me and i feel like this headset will be good for anyone to use if you can afford it, however the headset is heavy and may require a bit of time to get used to when you first try it out."
Abhishek Sen,5,"100%, for sure, anytime of the day, without a doubt, no question, easy choice, for sure ponder it, would pay a bil, worth every penny, the best, dont even not think about it, best investment, worth the buck, the dollar, the cent, buy it, youll be happy, yolo"
Penelope Seagrave,5,This is an incredible product that transports you into a magical experience for both focused productivity and surreal media consumption.
Andre Jamal,1,"I think its super cool, but the price is not meant for the everyday worker so until then, forget the Apple Pro Vision, we going to continue our quest."
Nick Greiner,5,Incredible product. Apple’s most exciting launch since the iPhone in 2007.
Demons General,5,This is something thats gonna change the way we interact with everything... This is gonna do what first smartphone did to telephone probably more..
James F.,5,"Beautiful filament used on this lightweight 3D printed stand, which perfectly holds my Vision Pro. Highly recommend!"
Paul D.,5,Exactly as described and shown in the photos. Very well designed and printed. Trust it to hold my AVP and battery.
Richard S.,5,Really does make the headset more comfortable. Great with no lightshield and also fits with a size 22W lightshield.
Lisa S.,5,I️ recommend this item every day to people I️nSpaze. It has been great for using the Apple Vision Pro comfortably for hours and hours.
Zach,5,This accessory increases FOV substantially and is more comfortable to wear.\nGreat communication from TY\nI would highly recommend his store
Salvatore M.,5,don't hesitate! great seller! great product! fast shipping!
awwwee,1,Buy an oculus instead. It's 20x cheaper and just much better in general. Don't waste your bread.
Salim Riley,5,Apple is making a big step in the right direction with this one. It’s a crazy time to be alive.
myshipmyrules,5,I use my Vision Pro in passthrough most of the time. Using this brings it closer to feeling like super high end AR glasses and I love it.
Joshua Thomas,5,"When I put on the apple vision pro headset, I felt like a new world has opened to me. I wish I wanted to wear it more, but I need to earn money in order to buy that headset."
FlyOnTheWallflower,1,i see people say stuff about the price and yeah i get it basically a meta quest 2 wish version so if apple could just lower the price a bit then i can see this getting 4 or 5 stars
synstelien,5,Great! Well designed and very comfortable. Fits and works with the light seal as well.
Paul,5,I’ve tried many third-party vision pro adapters and straps. This one is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use.
Aaron C.,5,"Great build quality, easy instructions and it’s super duper comfortable now. Really awesome stuff."
Austin J.,5,I use this every time! Way better for AVP to be like glasses instead of goggles. Thanks!
tervrt g,1,this is expensive a fake Meta Quest 3 off brand you are losing money I can download a Meta Quest is easy but the Apple Vision Pro needs a computer this is rigged
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Amazing product, made the Apple Vision Pro both more usable and more comfortable. Well worth the price."
Dan,5,I ordered from 3 suppliers on Etsy and this unit was by far the best. The other units were so so. This one was fantastic.
Noel B.,5,"Works great and love having the open face design. Ever since using the quest pro, this is a must for any headset I use now."
gary Fine,5,Perhaps Apple should lease this product like cars with a trade in value after 1 year so long as it still functions properly.
Anshu K.,5,The vision pro is amazing.Encounter dinosaurs is real.I won't spoil it anymore but try it.Five stars.
Sign in with Apple user,5,Had a simple question seller responded real quick shipping was good and this makes the AVP 100% easier on the cheeks a great device for a great device

Janek G.,1,Not looking good and very Slow. Can‘t recommend it. No Refound from Owner :(((
TALIA LACY,5,This is a five star because you could pick up stuff. Also I like it black it also comes with everything else.
Marcos M.,3,"The Velcro is not that strong and the pad doesn’t stick properly due the lack off Velcro , It might work for other people but not for me ."
Bozoton Rush,1,"Good for you, if you have $3500 for that. Also insultingly $6000 aswell on eBay."
Cameron Oelsen,5,"For those who are able to afford it, it is an awesome product for content consumption and work."
Nate Johnson,1,"All of apple's stuff is so expensive, you could buy a really high end pc with a good vr headset for $4,000"
Kevin S.,5,"Better than the similar Infinity One forehead rest, as this one can adjust to different forehead angles"
Retro Misfit,1,"Please don't waste money on this, just buy 6 quests for this price tag. Seriously, it's not worth it."
Noah Novak,1,get groceries instead or pay a house loan something instead of this goofy ahh eye bra :(((
Jake L,1,"super heavy product I don't really love it, it looks fascinating though"
John,5,Great product. Works as described. It will change how I use my AVP.
Steve,5,Very comfortable and nice to have an option to wear with peripheral vision. Glad I bought it

Nick W.,5,"Excellent solution for Apple Vision Pro comfort, especially for prolonged periods."
Joe S.,5,Great quality and quick shipping. Now my Vision Pro can finally be comfortably worn.
Ben Lee,5,I'VE BEEN STUCK IN THIS HEADSET FOR 72 HOURS NOW... I OPENED THE MOON ENVIRONMENT AND I CAN'T BREATH ANYMORE HELP M-

Aaron T.,5,Good product. Nice quality. Worked as advertised.
Tim B.,5,Well crafted and great for in office use because you're a little less isolated! Thank you!!!!
Leo,5,This fixes the worst aspects of the AVP. The absolute best adapter you can buy right now.

Josh H.,5,Smart design. Useful feature. Love it.
Karthik Saripalli,5,i love apple i like the apple vision pro since it has great features an is innovative technology
Xun Y.,5,This is really the best system for AVP out there. The padding is high quality as well
Greg C.,5,Love the item! Super comfortable. Seller had an issue with his supplier that delayed delivery but was so helpful and went out of his way to speed delivery to make up for it. I couldn’t be happier with both the product and the level of customer service.
Brendan Jarmusz,5,"much better once you use it yourself, miles ahead of any other headset on the market"
Mr Sprinter,1,Are you seriously going to spend 3500 dollars for this? Go buy a Metaquest.
Blah,5,Makes using AVP even more comfortable. Works exactly as described.
Scott msa,1,The idea of life is to get out and live it. Not imagine it and live it through goggles.
Sign in with Apple user,5,"I wasn’t familiar with the open face system, but this product was a great introduction to it."
Mr. W,1,"This product needs to be at most $2000, not starting at $3500"
Sid Chang,1,But I expect no less from the creators of the $999 monitor stand...
John L.,5,Great product! Fast Shipping!! Thank you again!!
etsy.com Shopper,5,Easy to attach. Definitely makes the Vision Pro feel much lighter.
Scott B.,5,The product works great and is the best option I’ve found yet for using no face shield with the AVP.
ayaan garg,1,"Too expensive bro, who pays like 4000 $ for a theatre which u can find at home. not worth it"

Isaiah Stauffer,2,Looks cool but to expensive it is to much money like 5000 dolars ridiculus
Joseph R.,5,Worth Every penny! makes the AVP way more ergonomic
The Roblox Boi's,1,"Why would anyone buy this, it seems to expensive for what you are getting"

Kevin Fuller,3,"The Apple Vision Pro is extremely innovative; there's no doubt about that. Watching movies, looking at old photos and/or videos, and playing the immersive games on the AVP are breathtaking. Seriously, those features on this headset are out of this world good and no other headset can replicate that experience at the moment. 

The ""passthrough"" feature is meh at best. I was able to walk around my college campus pretty well with these on. However, I made sure not to walk too fast as there's some latency with it. The FOV is pretty limited and I often found myself needing to check my surroundings quite often as you basically lose most if not all your peripheral vision when you put these on. Also, using my Apple Watch while wearing the AVP was very difficult as the text on the ...More"
Joseph Scroggins,2,"I have owned this device from the launch and I am beyond disappointed with apple. We are almost 6 months into the launch and it still feels like I am working with a BETA device/software. 

The apps on this device are VERY limited. You can't even arrange the apps on the home screen for easier use... they are just placed in alphabetical order and limited to a small amount per-page. Apple touts that it now has 1000+ apps for it, but majority of them are trash and useless. Apple didn't even have its own native apps available at first. Most of them are there now, but they don't operate to full capacity. It's definitely not like having a computer at your finger tips, it operates more like an iPad. I'm sorry, but I need more functionality for most of the things that I am doing and ...More"
Tyler Haupt,5,"Never before was there a more expensive way to experience the Allegorical Cave! 
I would like to thank the Apple Team for not only delivering on their promise to disconnect me further and further from the world, but also for allowing me to segment myself from society for the purposes of marketing. I hope my biometric, internet, and personal data is well utilized by the Apple Team so that they can best manipulate shadows in optimal patterns allowing me to cease all manor of individual thought and finally become a being of instinct and routine behaviors. Please continue to drip feed me the illusion of happiness through complacency so that the world will never need to challenge me ever again.

Sideboard,5,"If you like high-tech cutting-edge experiences, this is a product for you. Nothing else in the world offers this level of immersion and visual quality in a headset this lightweight and well-crafted. This is the Mona Lisa of Virtual Reality Headsets. You have to use Apple apps, not everything is available yet, but as a legitimate computing platform, software comes second to hardware. The haters of this product have no legs to stand on, as they have never even tried it out. Once you put on the headset, you are instantly aware that the future goes one of two ways: Immersive Mixed Reality Computing, or Heads-Up Display Augmented Reality. The Apple Vision Pro is a glimpse into one of our potential high-tech futures and I can't wait to watch the immersive shows that will be coming ...More"
James DeRose,4,"Absolutely love my Vision Pro. I was in the process of buying a new laptop (Currently own an M1 Pro) and planning on getting an M3. I wanted to know if the Vision pro could legitimately be used as a new computer? Yes and no. I would not sell my M1 as I use the Vision Pro as my second screen. There is a hefty cost to it, but lots of capabilities and more I am sure will come. There rarely are any Apple products that are ""cheap"" so it's tough when people say its way too expensive. I would suggest checking one out before buying it, but Apple definitely did a great job with this product and I am sure it will get better in the future. I have experienced minor bugs, but nothing crazy. Pros: Awesome display, great setup and compatibility. Cons: Price, touch sensitivity on occasion ...More"
Michael Min,5,"This is going to be a awesome product. It is meant for older people, so you should not buy it for your kid. However, it is a great product when you are bored of the outside. Also, this product is peasant money; anybody can buy this without breaking the bank. It can be pricey for some people, but overall Apple is going to make a fortune off this product. For example, Apple is making a lot of money off their stuff. So, this will make them even more money for the company. When this comes out, I am buying this thing no matter what! Lets go over the basics: One, the oculus battery dies out fast! I played it for 30 min, and my battery died. I feel like this battery is better than the other one. Two, why would apple just release this thing for the world of it. This product is going ...More"
Alexander G.,2,"The manufacturer seems like a nice person, but this thing is really such a disappointment. \n\n– The L/R tabs were of different tightnesses, the left side being too loose. \n– The velcro/pad are a total mismatch. The pad can slip off the forehead plate very very easily; try to make an adjustment and it'll likely slide. So you need to take the whole vision off and reset the positioning. \n– The velcro pad and the forehead plate are not sized to match. The pad's wings jut out the sides, plate's corners peek through top. \n– Adjustability is bare minimum. Can't change the angle at which the plate is held, and you can't hold the plate at a particular angle either–– it just sets into path of least resistance. Can't adjust the vertical distance of the plate. \n\nAllows open face ...More"
Guy C.,5,"Wow! This really works. I got the Basic Open Face System For the Apple Vision Pro and it REALLY helps with comfort. The included pad is very soft and the strap allows all the weight to be transferred to the forehead, eliminating the pressure on the face. It makes the Vision Pro feel lighter. (Actually, it is lighter without the light seal assembly). It is easy to put together and remove too. A few notes - the pad can be a bit difficult to get attached, though a slight flex of the plastic and wiggling of the pad gets it to secure better. The Vision Pro may also now alert you to the display being too close when you first put it on. Having the lenses closer does increase the FOV, though be careful if you walk around and bump something, since the lenses are closer to your eyes. I ...More"
Niranjan Bhat,5,"The transparent VR glass, eye & hand click are really from another level. You can see people automatically when you required!, AI will detect people. Quest 3 is better for games, but Vision pro experience as a professional & as a daily life is better. 
Main distinguish is other people can see your eyes, so you can talk without taking off everytime. 
Another big accomplishment is Real Avatar, Unlike quest 3 where you appear some funny animals, here in Vision pro, you actually look same as you! means live track your face and make 3D face avatar in real time and you can do facetime or walk through in the metaverse and meet your friends, You don't have to read your friend name on the avatar. Because you immediately recognize them and nobody looks funny avatars"
Brian Hernandez,1,"What is this supposed to be? It's front heavy VR headset. Please remove those goofy eyes from the front on the headset and either add a battery to the headset or have a battery with a removeable cable, as do you know how annoying the battery is with an attached cable. Not a lot of third party apps but I'm sure that will improve with time. No YouTube or Netflix thus alienates a good chunk unless you go through the browser. I understand the the metal on the front is to show off quality but it really adds to the front heaviness and while short term it's fine but long term its annoying. I can't justify this price because it doesn't have much of a use case and everyone is laughing at you when they see the eyes and not that I care much but the eyes on front look nothing like in the ...More"
Sign in with Apple user,5,"I came across this on Reddit and was very interested to see if it would work as well as advertised. I just received it, and let me tell you, it works extremely well. Does what it's supposed to. The FOV is greatly increased and absolutely no pressure on my cheeks, even with the solo strap. Also, in case anyone who uses the Zeiss lenses is wondering, this does work with them flawlessly. I did get the ""eyes too close,"" but I just dismiss the warning and smooth sailing from there. Will still use the light seal for movies but I can't ignore how much less isolated I feel while wearing. 5 stars all around."
Dom Meyer,4,"This may work well for many, but it works very poorly for my facial shape. It's impossible to keep the Vision Pro far enough from my eyes and nose while using this. Even when set at the furthest length, the open face system attachments slide away, causing the distance to drop and the Vision Pro to press against my nose. I've resorted to wrapping rubber bands around the Vision Pro arms to prevent this slipping, but even then the device is too close. Based on other reviews, it seems that this does work well for many face and head shapes, but if you have a big nose or more angular structure, this might not work well for you."
Niles,5,"All I can say is wow. I am a day one Vision Pro owner and I have tried most of the solutions to try to make it more comfortable. This forehead cushion is far and away the most ideal solution, and easily the most comfortable. It’s so easy to install, and it allows for very easy adjustments. The cushion is really high-quality as well. I have always struggled With the Vision Pro leaning on my nose, bridge, but this completely fixes the issue and allows me to use the headset without the light seal. Top-tier product!"
Nicholas C.,5,Spoke with the seller a day before I placed my order he responded quickly so I ordered and when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It’s obviously not something you would buy from the store quality as it’s 3D printed but the craftsmanship is really really good so no complaints. Just wanted to point that out for the really picky people. The unit is easily installed and works perfectly. The seller also included a QR code that links to how to install the unit. The instructions are easily followed. This is really cool and gives you a new way to enjoy the Apple Vision Pro.
Avesh J.,5,This thing has been a total game changer for my Apple Vision Pro. I was getting a little bummed out by all the pressure on my face when using the device. This thing has completely solved the problem and allows me to use the AVP for longer periods of time with no discomfort. The extra peripheral vision without the light seal is incredible and enhances the overall experience. I haven't used the light seal at all since I started using this. This really gets me excited about the possibilities with the AVP.
rmhall,5,"The Open Face System is a game changer for me. It makes wearing the Vision Pro so much more comfortable and makes the solo strap more functional without having to crank down the tightness. Now I can easily use it with or without the light shield as well, which has some great use cases. A must have purchase, and one, if not the best of the Vision Pro accessories I've picked up so far. I've had it for a few weeks now, and it is indispensable. Plenty of room for customization and tweaking too. Highly recommended!"
Paul D.,5,"I receieved exactly what was described. The adapters slide onto the AVP arms and the top pad snaps in and can be removed easily. The adapters don't have to be removed to go back to using the light shield. This is how Apple should have shipped the AVP. Without the light shield, it is basically like wearing a weightless pair of sunglasses and a hat. You can see out the sides for situational awareness. Good product, good value, good communication from seller and good shipping."
Jade Dumlao,1,"Ok, apple, if you think im spending 3500 bucks on a meta quest 2 ripoff, hell to the naw. Lets look at the comparisons, shall we?

The meta quest 2 and 3 can also do hand tracking.
They can also call phones and stuff
Be my guest if you wanna spend that much money on a gyatt dam headset
So, in conclusion, i dont think it should cost that much. Its insane. It should be like, 590 bucks or somethin i dont care if you spent 16 years on it. IT SHOULDNT BE THAT EXPENSIVE"
etsy.com Shopper,5,This thing is absolutely perfect. The cushion used along with the plastic allows it to flex a little bit over the top of your head - so it really doesn't apply much pressure (unlike the original Quest Pro design which was too hard. \n\nI was already modding the default configuration of the Vision Pro to make it more comfortable - and now this will be how I use it daily with the exception of using the interface while on flights. \n\nIf you're second guessing a purchase - do not hesitate. This turns the Vision Pro from something I could use for an hour at a time to ALL DAY (if I weren't married lol.)
Andrew R,2,"Innovative and love the idea however I priced mine out and with lenses, it will be 
 Apple Card Monthly Installments
$333.16/mo.per month for 12 months.
$3,998.00 Total
Price includes ZEISS Optical Inserts

I have better things to spend $4k on right now. 

Like the iPads and other Apple products Prices will come down in a couple of years once competitors come out. Right now the 1% and DIe hard techies will be buying these."
Vlad Chogoleff,1,"the product is truly amazing, the quality of the build, the picture quality, the apple ecosystem, but with 2 apps/videos available there is absolutly nothing to experience. The safari crashing like 30 times a day, the multi windows is getting blury, the lenses has a halo, the headset just simply doesn't work in a dark, and lastly the see thru quality is poor. I simply returned it, because after 2 days of playing it's start laying down on a couch and the $25/month applecare+ subscription won't help at all. Hope apple will come up with more content in a few years with a more reasonable price tag."
Rick Lay,3,"The clips don’t stay in place and slide forward. The AVP keeps telling me my eyes are too close to the lenses with and without inserts. When initially put on it is comfortable, but it does not stay in place. I’m concerned that after multiple installs and uninstalls, it will wear...I would have preferred the versions where the arms needed to be removed. It's probably safer. It may work for some people depending on the positioning and head size, but it not right for my big head. Took almost 2 weeks to arrive (because of the pad)."
Scott R.,5,This new stand is fantastic. Its sleek design is shaped to contour to the Vision Pro perfectly. I love this marble material option as it goes great with the black and white esthetics of the AVP. \n\nIt also works great with the new face shield provided separately from the same company. It alleviates some of the pressure from the face but also works with and without the Apple light leak shield. \n\nI highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed.
Cole Klingler,5,"Innovative product that increases efficiency. I highly recommend, the price tag is a burden but remember Apple allows credit monthly payment plans. Be sure to tell your cooperate supervisor that the apple eco system will promote a cutting edge solution that is corporate fatigue. Apple Vison Pro has a partnership with ""ZEISS"" Carl Zeiss AG is a swiss company known for their craftsmanship and high precession instruments that meet the demand of todays problems in all forms of sectors."
William T.,5,"Honestly, a game changer. I initially had the Vision Pro too close to my face, but after moving it back as far as possible, everything just felt right. It’s SO much more comfortable without the light shield. \n\nOnly complaint is the shield does not slide in easily, though I assume that’s to prevent it from falling out. The overall feel is fantastic, and it’s very easy to switch back. And everything still fits in my case."
Spring Complete,5,I really like it. It is better than the Quest 3 and has stunning visuals. Nothing quite as stunning as watching a movie in there with the equivalent of a 200 inch screen. And i can get quite a bit of work there done too with all the windows on display and easy accessibility. Only real complaint is the power situation which with the brick is not gracefully managed and the battery life being short.
Shaurya Tomar,2,"Great idea, I hope that Apple implements it well and this device actually becomes a productive device which can be seen in modern work-spaces.
But, just like every other Apple product, the price of this product is also through the roof. I would have appreciated even if apple sold this for 2000 USD. If 3500 USD is the cost of the first generation, I can do nothing but sink in sorrow when I think of the price of the next generations."
Vlary N.,5,It does exactly what it is intended to do. Now I can finally enjoy AVP for long periods of time. The only problem I have is the Velcro. It’s pretty weak and doesn’t stay on plastic especially when I adjust the plastic piece it disconnects. Solution is to just glue it or get a better one from Michael’s or something. I think it may not work for everyone bc of head size and hair. But it’s worth a try for 40$ or so
Laughter Centralize,1,"A month later! and my 600 dollar oculus is still more useful. Id feel better IF I SPENT 4k DOLLARS ON THE OCULUS!!!! All that 8k video! Picture! USELESSSSSSSSSS! I rather use my phone! Its a big iPhone on your face! 1 day of having, you watch some youtube, play cut the rope and get bored! By 3 days of using this you wont want to use it anymore"
Kenneth K.,5,"The seller went above and beyond and even threw in some free stuff. The quality of the product is amazing. It’s exactly what I was looking for and believe me I tried so many different printers and brands. And no, not all 3d prints are the same. Designs quality of materials even the way they print it all differs quite a bit. You get what you pay for. This is indeed the best out there."
Brenden Lane,5,wow it was so fun and good to use. the radiation in my eyes goes away after a few days. But I think there was a side affect. I can now breath colors and see in the dark. oh but at least I can now watch skibidi toilit in AR! which is a majore plus. over all very good product. however money is to big for sigma males as myself. ;)
Kane,5,"There are a number of different mods being created to make the Vision Pro headset more comfortable, I've tried a few and the open face design by TycoTech is by far the best one I've tried to date. It's easy to install/remove in less than a minute, so you can switch between the open face or the standard light shield setup depending on your preference. The open face design also distributes the weight off my cheeks making it more comfortable to wear for longer periods."
Jean-Denis H.,5,"Got mine yesterday (v2) and I tried it out today for 2 hours and it’s been GREAT. Installation was very straightforward (v3 looks even better), peripheral vision was great, very comfortable with nothing touching your face except your forehead. The controls worked perfectly as well. Glad to know that extra pads will be purchasable, that way I’ll have a “work” one and one or two “exercise” ones."
J S.,5,"This strap is REMARKABLE!! I feel zero pressure wearing my Vision Pro sitting, standing, or laying down. The two small clips included with the strap also help keep it in place and not slide. I've tried all sorts of comfort straps before (Annapro, AirCover, etc.) and none of them even come close to the level of comfort that this strap provides. I'm beyond impressed!"
Ozzie B.,5,"This is almost perfect for me. I won't ding it any stars, because it could be 100% perfect for someone else. That's just how it goes with things that are meant to fit a human head. As far as concept and build quality, it's better than anything I've tried to date. I'm waiting for some adapters to change the angle of the AVP knit strap, and I think after that, my search for what works for me will finally be over."
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Game changer for enabling multi-hour wearing. Makes the AVP truly usable for long sessions of spatial computing deep work and video meetings. No more face fatigue, face marks or perspiration. Can be used with or without light seal - without is best for long hours of work, with for immersive movie watching."
SRQ Fugate,5,"All these 1 star reviews, are from all the jealous poors. Butt hurt from too many combo meals, and looking in the mirror to often. Cant afford something that would require them to save money. Maybe not blow it all on meth and empty calories. Afford something nice, that wasn't stolen for a change."
willg97,5,Easily the best Vision Pro system. Combined with the 2x Solo Strap solution and setup was easy. New version pops on/off easily while feeling very secure. \n\nTook a couple minutes to find the best position but zero face pressure now and my head feels much lighter with the pressure more evenly distributed across the top/back. Thanks!
Jyles S.,3,Item is of god quality I understand it’s 3d printed so not too critical of that. Biggest flaw with open facing Vision Pro is that the bottom of the head set rests on the bridge of my nose and after prolonged use it begins to hurt a bit. I think I’ll stick to the light seal for now. I do like the idea of the open face concept and if think it surges more of a better AR experience.
Ganda,3,"The open face is definitely superior compared to using the light seal, but the seller should elaborate more about different sizes. I bought the standard one only to find the lenses is too close to the eyes and also because the arms moved closer to the display upon tightening. Upon asking for help, I was told about the larger size which he offered at a discount."
Nigel Arockiaraj,5,My wife boyfriend bought me this as a christmas gift and this was very good one. At night time I put on nice videos with lotion and get a lot of comfert very nice one. When the the 6'5 black man gave me lap dance I felt it.My wife left yesterday and i didnt even notice she left very good product very nice !!!!!!! Also I am black and like lady boys.
Duncan H,1,"My title says it all, probably the last Apple Product I buy, everything is locked to their ecosystem so there is such limited functionality it is sad. The marketing is extremely misleading the front facing LCD that displays your eyes is terrible quality. False advertising in my opinion, there will probably be a lawsuit."
Ronnie R.,5,"Good quality product. It works well to take pressure off your cheeks. I prefer the dual knit setup best, but this is a good alternative if you want to remove the light seal. I didn't find removing the light seal to be a major improvement and I prefer the immersive feel."
STEVEN N.,5,I am using the Dual solo knit band set up. Very comfortable. Works with and without light seal. although attaching the light seal a little finicky. I now prefer to use my AVP without the light seal. Extra bulk makes it more difficult to fit in my case.
Mike W.,5,Excellent seller! Extremely communicative and friendly. I was previously using a different bobo vr solution but ty’s is superior in comfort and usability. Highly recommend this open face product If you’re finding the Apple Vision Pro uncomfortable.
Bryan Williams,5,"Cool product and fair price for being able to do anything your mac or iPhone can do and more. Basically anything in the digital realm could be seen and heard realistically in your physical space!

People have no problem paying thousands of dollars for a Macbook or mac studio and this does even more and they haven't even scratched the surface yet!"
Derek C.,5,"Awesome accessory for the vision pro. I have the annapro headstrap and this is way better. Shipping was fast, and even came with spare parts which by no means was necessary, but greatly appreciated as I ended up needing after dropping and breaking a piece. 10/10 would buy again!"
mbsneider,5,"Really reduces the AVP’s weight and it’s more comfortable than the whole light seal pressing on your face. Might still want to use the light seal if watching a movie in an immersive environment, but otherwise it’s more comfortable with the open face system for general use. Recommended."
Neil J.,5,"Great product. Makes wearing the Vision Pro feel like nothing. Only negative I can tell is that it isn’t compatible with the light shield, but it is honestly better without. \n\nThe pad is a great, doesn’t leave a red mark on my head after wearing the headset from 100% to 0% which was crazy."
Carter Jackson,3,I feel like the people who give it 5 stars are people who work for apple and are trying to make the product look good. either way 3500 friggin dollars is a little pricey and over all just seemed kinda bad from the start. I have a feeling this is gonna go bad and there are gonna be some malfunctions and health care issues. And if not then well o well.
LiamGoose,5,"ok, I was skeptical about the price, but when I bought it I was greatly surprised. I was a homeless guy with nothing but $3499 to my name, I decided to pull the trigger and purchase the vision pro. When the vision pro arrived it saved my life, I was able to get a job, get a family, and my life went uphill.

Thanks Apple !!!"
Allen I.,5,"This is by far the most comfortable one in the entire market. I’ve tried literally literally every single one. .The solo knit adapters do not work for me. I had to use a different one that I purchased from someone else But outside of that, it’s incredible"
Eddie StL,5,"I love my Vision Pro. I got it about a week after launch, and to this day i use it daily. I’ve traveled with it a few times and i can no longer travel without it. While everyone has their tv screen on the plane, im fully immersed in a movie theatre thanks to Apple TV cinema mode. I can’t wait for VOS2"
Sigma Fanum,1,just get a quest 3. atleast you can play games on the quest 3. can’t even get games. you can literally do everything on the vision pro on a iphone. the quest 3 is like the vision pro but better in every way. apple needs to start actually making cheap products.
Constantine,5,"This is great. I personally use it with the dual strap setup, and the light seal still attached. It still works perfectly and I’m not suffering with the light splash and glare that comes without the light seal. Thank you!"
Inactive,4,"So far it's *almost* perfect. Unfortunately I do need ticker padding, so I'm re-using some from my PSVR2 globular-cluster. \n\nOther than that, the print quality is great, it doesn't look like a cheap print at all, and frankly the AVP looks sexier without the light seal anyways :)"
Nelson C.,5,"I think the open face pad is great and my only quibble is it may be too wide at the wing tips and not really sure if those should be outside the arms or tucked in. Overall it is so nice to lift the main AVP unit away from the cheeks and forehead to have it suspended over your eyes instead, and that achieves that full stop.\n\nFor the bobovr clips, just 2 suggestions:\n\n1) was my tolerances were pretty tight on mine so it does take a bit of force to pop them out from the AVP arms.\n\n2) It would be nice if they had just a teeny bit of padding inside (thin foam/felt/cushion) as when you combine the open face pad + the bobovr m1 plus/m3 mini it does lose the flex from the AVP arms and the whole thing becomes quite rigid, meaning that the adapter clips can rub up against the ...More"
Jerry,5,"This really does a lot to help with the AVP's weight. I can wear it for a lot longer now, and as a bonus the FOV is massively increased. Super great for productivity since i no longer feel like I'm wearing blinders. It feels more like you're wearing big glasses!"
Navan H.,3,Fast shipping. Taking on and off is difficult if you’re trying to switch between different use cases. Pad is uneven and falls off after use when adjusting. Overall still a good product and functions as intended.
mpmorgan83,5,"All looks as advertised! Really like new, as far as I can tell. Awesome. Thanks!!"
Jeff McMorris,5,I really like this headset mount. It makes the Vision Pro way more comfortable. I highly recommend it. It removes all pressure from your face. You can make it so it doesn’t even touch your face.
Izan Fayos,1,I mean I saw the vision of it but instead of buying weird Apple Pros and Apple products why not just buy regular Granny Smith Apples? Metallic taste and some woman named Siri kept on telling me not to put it in the oven to make Apple Pro Pie. Worst 3500 ever.
milkncrackas,4,"Ahead of its time. Huge potential for the future of computing, but the lack of early apps makes it difficult to give a 5 star review."
Miguel N.,4,"I’m pretty happy with the product and shipping process. It helps with better comfort that it is the key about it and the reason I think worth it.\n\nOn the other hand, IMHO, it is a bit expensive for a plastic printed, not a professional looking product, but, offering enough comfort solution to appreciate it."
John L.,5,"Absolutely awesome!! Made using my Vision Pro a joy for long periods of time. Really well made. Very clean, especially for something that was 3D printed. Really happy with my purchase"
Aaron T.,5,Good product. Good customer support. You can use the AVP without the light seal. The locking mechanism is now upgraded and Ty now provides extra XL size for the forehead support.
Kengine,5,"Works extremely well as described. The Vision Pro floats about your nose with the support being on your forehead. Would love to see a version with small blinders on the sides to reduce light leak glare, but still works great."
Kelly Kasik,5,"I took the demo at the Apple Store and walked out with a new Vision Pro. WOW, amazing. Everything from the photos, movies, apps this product was amazing. I want to go to Mt. Hood in Oregon now. Give it a try!!!!"
SuperFlame KB,1,"Bro Apple's actually crazy. Steve Jobs really wants us to buy this stinkin' MetaQuest 2 and 3 rip-off for like 4 grand. Bro, I could literally buy a multiple flights around the world for this. DO NOT BUY"
Devin,5,I have an oculus quest at home with hand tracking which is good. I went to try this at apple store and it has eye tracking too. Everything is so realistic. I would definitely buy it if it wasn't 4000 DOLLARS
Mike Orren,4,"Sure, it's heavy. And it doesn't fulfill every single dream every single customer had.

It's still indistinguishable from magic. And gets better each day."
makr mania,5,"awesome! I actually bought it, unlike the broke people commenting here. truly revolutionary. A great first product that shows where computing can and will go"
Doreen Aziz,1,"Way way too much money not enough apps extremely. Heavy head set meta quest.
 Right now is your way to go. Sorry , apple Also does not respond when it is too dark"
Will at Hilldrup Rawls,1,commercials looked awesome. i'm sure the product doesn't disappoint. now we wait for v. 3.0 where it's affordable to everyday individuals and not strictly for corporate use (or the very wealthy)
AHA,5,"It costs 3500 usd, that's like 86161250.00. You cannot even get one in Vietnam. You have to fly to USA to get one. Which costs $1000. Do not buy one of these!"
AlphaNeon,1,"What's the point of this headset in the first place? To play games? To be a private web browser on your face?

What is the point?"
Brandon H.,5,It makes the AVP feel like it’s significantly lighter. Almost as comfortable as a Valve Index. And that’s a huge compliment. Great design!
Nino,5,"The components are of quality and the fit and functionality are amazing. Totally worth owning if you're an AVP owner, this has made viewing content lying down so much more comfortable, taking all of the weight off of your face."
Vamsi Karnati,1,"How can we record a video or some training if we want to, maybe if not allowed to record on App. In real scenario we can use a phone to record, but how with this googles...... VERY FUNNY SCHEMES...GOOD LUCK SELLING."
Egg,1,I was driving with the vision pros on and the battery ended up dyeing which caused the entire screen to go black. THIS DEVICE ALMOST KILLED ME. DONT DRIVE WITH THEM
Douglas N.,5,Nice quality Apple Vision Pro 3d printed support. Easily assembled. Great instructions. Printed and shipped promptly.
Jas,3,"The velcro barely sticks, and the connector of the forehead wears out after a couple of times and will slip out of the socket. The idea is very good and does work, but the quality could be better."
Finland Six,1,"The vision pro is a no-go, I'd highly discourage anyone from buying this product and checking out any of the other VR headsets available for a fraction of the price. Will be seeking refund"
Robert,5,Works as it should. Keeps my AVP off my face comfortably. Very easy to construct. Very clever and well made.
Eliot G.,5,Incredible upgrade that adds comfort and functionality to the Vision Pro. Thoughtfully engineered and well produced. A great value too!
Akoni A.,5,"The Velcro to attach the padding could be better, but that’s the only improvement that could be made to this product. 5/5 overall. Great job!"
Owen Yang,5,"This is going to be a massive leap for the tech industry, I think that the price is a little bit overpriced. But once the consumer version comes out it will be a big jump"
razmtaz1987,5,Works great! Definitely makes the AVP more tolerable to wear. Amazing Apple didn't do something like this built into the light bands.
Sign in with Apple user,5,Went from only being able to wear my AVP comfortably for around 30 minutes to no pain at all for two hours straight. This is a must buy for anyone who has an AVP that is sensitive to face pressure.
Scott R.,5,Buy from this guy if you want the highest quality designs that just work! His reviews and products speak for themself! Highly recommend!
SS Shack,1,"The apple vision pro is way too expensive for its features and it has multiple glitches, also you can barely interact with family and call others when using the vision pro since it is an artificial version of the person."
T. W.,5,This open face system does a surprisingly competent job of comfortably redistributing the weight. Great alternate to the light seal!
C K.,5,This item is allowing me to finally enjoy using my Apple Vision Pro. No more heavy weight pressing on my abused sinuses. Thank you!
Trevon B.,5,I installed mine upside down and it feels better for me. Takes the pressure off your cheeks and makes wearing this without the light seal game changer.
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Excellent item. Gets the weight of the VP off your face entirely. I cut the edges of the pad down, so I can use it with or without the light shield."
Anthony Tran,5,"When i first tried out the headset, I was honestly surprised with how well the device worked for me and i feel like this headset will be good for anyone to use if you can afford it, however the headset is heavy and may require a bit of time to get used to when you first try it out."
Abhishek Sen,5,"100%, for sure, anytime of the day, without a doubt, no question, easy choice, for sure ponder it, would pay a bil, worth every penny, the best, dont even not think about it, best investment, worth the buck, the dollar, the cent, buy it, youll be happy, yolo"
Penelope Seagrave,5,This is an incredible product that transports you into a magical experience for both focused productivity and surreal media consumption.
Andre Jamal,1,"I think its super cool, but the price is not meant for the everyday worker so until then, forget the Apple Pro Vision, we going to continue our quest."
Nick Greiner,5,Incredible product. Apple’s most exciting launch since the iPhone in 2007.
Demons General,5,This is something thats gonna change the way we interact with everything... This is gonna do what first smartphone did to telephone probably more..
James F.,5,"Beautiful filament used on this lightweight 3D printed stand, which perfectly holds my Vision Pro. Highly recommend!"
Paul D.,5,Exactly as described and shown in the photos. Very well designed and printed. Trust it to hold my AVP and battery.
Richard S.,5,Really does make the headset more comfortable. Great with no lightshield and also fits with a size 22W lightshield.
Lisa S.,5,I️ recommend this item every day to people I️nSpaze. It has been great for using the Apple Vision Pro comfortably for hours and hours.
Zach,5,This accessory increases FOV substantially and is more comfortable to wear.\nGreat communication from TY\nI would highly recommend his store
Salvatore M.,5,don't hesitate! great seller! great product! fast shipping!
awwwee,1,Buy an oculus instead. It's 20x cheaper and just much better in general. Don't waste your bread.
Salim Riley,5,Apple is making a big step in the right direction with this one. It’s a crazy time to be alive.
myshipmyrules,5,I use my Vision Pro in passthrough most of the time. Using this brings it closer to feeling like super high end AR glasses and I love it.
Joshua Thomas,5,"When I put on the apple vision pro headset, I felt like a new world has opened to me. I wish I wanted to wear it more, but I need to earn money in order to buy that headset."
FlyOnTheWallflower,1,i see people say stuff about the price and yeah i get it basically a meta quest 2 wish version so if apple could just lower the price a bit then i can see this getting 4 or 5 stars
synstelien,5,Great! Well designed and very comfortable. Fits and works with the light seal as well.
Paul,5,I’ve tried many third-party vision pro adapters and straps. This one is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use.
Aaron C.,5,"Great build quality, easy instructions and it’s super duper comfortable now. Really awesome stuff."
Austin J.,5,I use this every time! Way better for AVP to be like glasses instead of goggles. Thanks!
tervrt g,1,this is expensive a fake Meta Quest 3 off brand you are losing money I can download a Meta Quest is easy but the Apple Vision Pro needs a computer this is rigged
etsy.com Shopper,5,"Amazing product, made the Apple Vision Pro both more usable and more comfortable. Well worth the price."
Dan,5,I ordered from 3 suppliers on Etsy and this unit was by far the best. The other units were so so. This one was fantastic.
Noel B.,5,"Works great and love having the open face design. Ever since using the quest pro, this is a must for any headset I use now."
gary Fine,5,Perhaps Apple should lease this product like cars with a trade in value after 1 year so long as it still functions properly.
Anshu K.,5,The vision pro is amazing.Encounter dinosaurs is real.I won't spoil it anymore but try it.Five stars.
Sign in with Apple user,5,Had a simple question seller responded real quick shipping was good and this makes the AVP 100% easier on the cheeks a great device for a great device

TALIA LACY,5,This is a five star because you could pick up stuff. Also I like it black it also comes with everything else.
Marcos M.,3,"The Velcro is not that strong and the pad doesn’t stick properly due the lack off Velcro , It might work for other people but not for me ."
Bozoton Rush,1,"Good for you, if you have $3500 for that. Also insultingly $6000 aswell on eBay."
Cameron Oelsen,5,"For those who are able to afford it, it is an awesome product for content consumption and work."
Nate Johnson,1,"All of apple's stuff is so expensive, you could buy a really high end pc with a good vr headset for $4,000"
Kevin S.,5,"Better than the similar Infinity One forehead rest, as this one can adjust to different forehead angles"
Retro Misfit,1,"Please don't waste money on this, just buy 6 quests for this price tag. Seriously, it's not worth it."
Noah Novak,1,get groceries instead or pay a house loan something instead of this goofy ahh eye bra :(((
Jake L,1,"super heavy product I don't really love it, it looks fascinating though"

Blah,5,Makes using AVP even more comfortable. Works exactly as described.

Sign in with Apple user,5,"I wasn’t familiar with the open face system, but this product was a great introduction to it."
